What is it?
==================

A 'game' aiming at motivating students getting involved in their learning experience.

Website is managed using the excellent CMS Processwire (http://processwire.com) developped by Ryan Cramer.

The 'demo' site (actually not demo since I use it with my students) is there : http://planetalert.tuxfamily.org
